The dataset used in this project includes features such  as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth, among others. Diabetes Prediction This project focuses on developing a predictive model for diabetes detection using machine learning algorithms.  The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of classification algorithms to  achieve accurate and reliable predictions. MNIST Digits Classification The MNIST Digit Classification is a fundamental undertaking in the field of computer vision and machine  learning, focusing on the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This dataset comprises 28x28  pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and serves as a benchmark for developing and  evaluating image classification algorithms.
